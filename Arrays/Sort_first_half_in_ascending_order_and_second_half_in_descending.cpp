// Certainly! The code provided is attempting to sort an array of integers in a specific way. Let's break down the algorithm:

// 1. **asceDesc Function**:
//     - Takes an array of integers `a[]` and its size as input.
//     - Contains two nested loops for sorting.
//     - The first loop is intended to sort the first half of the array in ascending order using a variation of bubble sort.
//     - The second loop is meant to sort the second half of the array in descending order using another variation of bubble sort.
//     - After sorting, it prints the entire array.

// 2. **Main Function**:
//     - Initializes an array of integers.
//     - Calculates the size of the array.
//     - Calls the `asceDesc` function with the array and its size.

// Algorithm steps:

// - The first loop (from 0 to size-1) sorts the first half of the array (`a[0]` to `a[size/2-1]`) in ascending order.
// - The inner loop within the first half iterates and swaps adjacent elements if `a[j] > a[j+1]`, which aims to sort the first half in ascending order.

// - The second loop (from size/2 to size-1) sorts the second half of the array (`a[size/2]` to `a[size-1]`) in descending order.
// - The inner loop within the second half iterates and swaps adjacent elements if `a[j] < a[j+1]`, which aims to sort the second half in descending order.

// - Finally, it prints the sorted array elements.

// However, this specific sorting method, as written in the code, doesn't guarantee a fully sorted array in both ascending and descending orders because the sorting logic isn't accurate. The mixing of two different sorting techniques applied separately to the first and second halves of the array won't produce a fully sorted array in both orders.
